To ensure my code, program or software is funcitonal and secure I have leared to test often even after small additions to a program.

To interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program all steps of the development process need to be carefully executed especially in the beginning stages. Understanding user needs will be what makes a program successful or not.

I approach desining software as a very step by step procedure. There are many checkpoints along the way and it is more about taking little steps and making sure everything is correct before moving on. I have definitely learned that when it comes to desinging software, it is quality over quantity.
